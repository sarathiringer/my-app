# 1. How long time did you end up spending on this coding test?

I spent 34 hours on the project, some more productive; some less. I was new to both web development in general and JavaScript, React and Node in particular, and so I had to do some tutorials once in a while to figure out what I was actually doing. 

# 2. Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.

I’ve used JavaScript, with React for front-end and node for the back-end. Front-end-wise I built a dropzone for easy upload, with the initial plan to include a progress bar. For the back-end, I built an express server and dealt with the data processing through smaller steps and functions. 

This choice of structure was honestly almost only based on how I could proceed step-by-step with the project. I didn’t really know where to begin, but I decided to start out by figuring out how to let the user upload files. Pink Programming once held a workshop on web development with React that I had attended a little bit, so I just started with that. This lead me to start building the interface and file upload with the help of a tutorial, which used node and express server for back-end. I know this doesn’t sound very professional - but it’s the truth! I didn’t know where to start so I simply took it step by step. Along the way, I’ve learned that using Javascript all the way through (instead of .NET) can help developers to cooperate by enabling people to move better over the whole stack. 

# 3. What would you add to your solution if you had more time? 

- First of all - I would have made it work all the way through!
- I would have figured out how to slow down the progress bar so it would be useful for the user.
- I would have made the displaying of the processed text pretty - not super ugly like it is right now…
- I would have made features for dealing with the same word appearing equally often, numbered lists being in the text, empty files, and numbers and symbols right next to the most used word.

# 4. What did you think of this recruitment test?

I thought it was really hard, but that also meant I learned very much from working on it!
